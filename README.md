### 💬 About me 

I've been an active Open Source developer for over 25 years (even before that term was actually coined). At ☀️ day I'm a software development team lead in the automotive area. At 🌑 night and during 🏖️ weekends I mostly contribute to Open Source projects related to 3D realtime graphics using open standards from [Khronos](https://www.khronos.org).
